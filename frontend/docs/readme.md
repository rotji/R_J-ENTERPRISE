# R_J ENTERPRISE

## 📌 Project Overview  
R_J ENTERPRISE is a collaborative platform where individuals contribute equal amounts of money to pool resources for bulk purchasing of goods. The purchased goods are then shared equally among all participants, maximizing value and reducing individual costs.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend Framework:** Vite + React + TypeScript  
- **Styling:** (To be implemented when necessary; no global styles applied initially)

## 📁 Documentation  
All developer-related documentation is organized inside the `docs/` folder, containing the following markdown files:

- `developerschecklist.md` – Feature-by-feature task tracking  
- `logics.md` – Pseudocode and logic planning for all components  
- `problemsolving techniques.md` – Common solutions and debugging approaches  
- `projectstructure.md` – Folder and file organization strategy  
- `restful api.md` – API structure, conventions, and endpoints

---

> This project is under continuous development. Features and logic will be implemented iteratively as real challenges arise.

## 📦 Tailwind CSS Setup

Tailwind CSS has been successfully installed and configured for this Vite + React + TypeScript project.

---

### ✅ Installation

From the project root (`frontend` folder), run the following commands:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

---

### ✅ Configuration

#### 1. `tailwind.config.js`

Tailwind was initialized with the default configuration. The content paths include:

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

---

#### 2. `postcss.config.js`

Tailwind and Autoprefixer are registered as PostCSS plugins:

```js
export default {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

---

#### 3. `src/index.css`

Tailwind’s base layers are included here:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

This file is already imported in `main.tsx`.

---

### ✅ Cleanup

- The default `App.css` file (generated by Vite) has been removed to avoid interference with Tailwind.
- Tailwind CSS is now the primary styling method for the project.
- Any scoped styles going forward will use CSS Modules (`*.module.css`) if needed.

---

> ⚠️ You may restart VS Code if Tailwind IntelliSense or CSS rules show warning signs.

## 🔄 Important Updates

### June 9, 2025 - Tailwind CSS PostCSS Plugin Update

If you encounter any issues with this update, refer to the detailed documentation in `docs/postcss-esmodule-error.md`.

## 🔧 Backend & Database (Basic Setup)

The backend is built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **TypeScript**, connected to **MongoDB Atlas**.

---

### ✅ Backend Setup Summary

- Initialized backend in `backend/` directory.
- Installed core packages:
  ```bash
  npm install express mongoose dotenv cors
  npm install -D typescript ts-node-dev @types/node @types/express
  ```
- Created `tsconfig.json` with `src/` as root and `dist/` as output.
- Folder structure includes:
  ```
  src/
  ├── config/         # MongoDB connection
  ├── controllers/    # (future) Route logic
  ├── models/         # (future) Mongoose schemas
  ├── routes/         # (future) Express routes
  └── index.ts        # Server entry point
  ```
- Created MongoDB connection in `src/config/db.ts`.
- Created server in `src/index.ts` with `/` test route.
- Added `.env` for `PORT` and `MONGO_URI`.

---

### ✅ MongoDB Atlas Setup

- Connected MongoDB Atlas via Mongoose.
- Environment variable `MONGO_URI` stores connection string securely.

---

### ✅ Scripts

### ✅ MongoDB Atlas Setup

- Connected MongoDB Atlas via Mongoose.
- Environment variable `MONGO_URI` stores connection string securely.

---

### ✅ Scripts

Added to `package.json`:
```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn src/index.ts",
  "build": "tsc",
  "start": "node dist/index.js"
}
```

---

> Run the server with:  
> `npm run dev`  
> You should see MongoDB connection and server running on port 5000.

Added to `package.json`:
```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn src/index.ts",
  "build": "tsc",
  "start": "node dist/index.js"
}
```

---

> Run the server with:  
> `npm run dev`  
> You should see MongoDB connection and server running on port 5000.

Open your project folder:
C:\Users\Dell\Desktop\R_J ENTERPRISE\backend\src
touch index.ts

## Backend Environment & Logging Setup

### ✅ Environment Variables
We added a `.env` file to manage environment-specific variables:

```env
# Server
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5000

# MongoDB
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here
```

- `PORT`: Defines the server port.
- `NODE_ENV`: Controls environment behavior (`development` or `production`).
- `SERVER_URL`: Base URL for server requests.

---

### ✅ Morgan - HTTP Request Logger
- Only active in **development mode**.
- Logs all HTTP requests (method, route, response time, etc.).
- Helps track API activity during development.

Usage (inside `index.ts`):
```ts
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
  const morgan = require("morgan");
  app.use(morgan("dev"));
}
```

---

### ✅ Winston - Application Logger
- Logs backend events (info, errors, etc.) with timestamps.
- Supports output to console and future file logging.
- Centralizes logging logic using a `logger.ts` utility.

Basic usage example:
```ts
import logger from "./utils/logger";

logger.info("Server started...");
logger.error("Something went wrong");
```

---

These tools improve error tracking, debugging, and backend observability during development and production.

create a folder mkdir logs in our backend path then create file error.log and combined.log
