# R_J ENTERPRISE

## 📌 Project Overview  
R_J ENTERPRISE is a collaborative platform where individuals contribute equal amounts of money to pool resources for bulk purchasing of goods. The purchased goods are then shared equally among all participants, maximizing value and reducing individual costs.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend Framework:** Vite + React + TypeScript  
- **Styling:** (To be implemented when necessary; no global styles applied initially)

## 📁 Documentation  
All developer-related documentation is organized inside the `docs/` folder, containing the following markdown files:

- `developerschecklist.md` – Feature-by-feature task tracking  
- `logics.md` – Pseudocode and logic planning for all components  
- `problemsolving techniques.md` – Common solutions and debugging approaches  
- `projectstructure.md` – Folder and file organization strategy  
- `restful api.md` – API structure, conventions, and endpoints

---

> This project is under continuous development. Features and logic will be implemented iteratively as real challenges arise.

## 📦 Tailwind CSS Setup

Tailwind CSS has been successfully installed and configured for this Vite + React + TypeScript project.

---

### ✅ Installation

From the project root (`frontend` folder), run the following commands:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

---

### ✅ Configuration

#### 1. `tailwind.config.js`

Tailwind was initialized with the default configuration. The content paths include:

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

---

#### 2. `postcss.config.js`

Tailwind and Autoprefixer are registered as PostCSS plugins:

```js
export default {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

---

#### 3. `src/index.css`

Tailwind’s base layers are included here:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

This file is already imported in `main.tsx`.

---

### ✅ Cleanup

- The default `App.css` file (generated by Vite) has been removed to avoid interference with Tailwind.
- Tailwind CSS is now the primary styling method for the project.
- Any scoped styles going forward will use CSS Modules (`*.module.css`) if needed.

---

> ⚠️ You may restart VS Code if Tailwind IntelliSense or CSS rules show warning signs.
