Understand the Problem Or You’re Just Guessing in Code

The biggest mistake most devs make isn’t syntax errors.
It’s trying to solve a problem they don’t truly understand.

You open your code editor, confident you’ll fix it.
But hours later:

* Nothing works.
* Everything’s broken.
* And now you’ve made it worse.

Why? Because you skipped the most important step:
Understanding the problem.

1. Don’t Assume

It’s easy to think you know what’s broken.
But tech problems often lie beneath the surface.

Before you write a single line of code, ask:

* What’s the actual issue?
* Can I replicate the bug?
* Is it happening for all users or just a specific case?
* Is the problem in the logic, the data, or the environment?

Assumptions waste time.
Clarity saves it.

2. Ask “Why” Until It Hurts

A senior dev doesn’t just see the symptom they ask why until they uncover the real cause and boom, now you’re solving the root, not the leaves.

3. Don’t Touch the Code (Yet)

It’s tempting to start fixing things immediately.
But that often leads to more chaos.

Instead, step back:

* Map the flow
* Check the inputs and outputs
* Log values
* Write down the expected vs actual behavior

Treat it like a detective case. Don’t move until the pieces make sense.

4. Visualize It

Draw the flow on a whiteboard, in Notion, or even on paper.
When you see the flow, you spot the break.

Most complicated problems are just poorly visualized logic.

5. Think Like the User, Not Just the Coder

Sometimes the problem isn’t technical.
It’s how the user expected something to work.

You might say, “The code is working.”
But if the experience is broken, the problem is still real.

Understanding a problem includes understanding the people using your solution.

6. Communicate Before You Fix

If you're working in a team or for a client clarify the problem with them before solving it.

What you think is broken might not match what they actually want fixed.

Understanding includes listening.

My Advice:
In tech, the axe is your understanding.
Sharpen it.
Or you’ll be swinging blindly for hours.

Anyone can write code.
Only the best can solve the right problem.

Stateless vs Stateful: Why It’s More Than Just Keeping Data

If you’ve ever been confused about what it really means for a system, server, or API to be stateless or stateful, you’re not alone.

These are foundational concepts in computing, networking, and system design but they're often misunderstood or oversimplified.

Let’s clear the air.

⚙️ What is State?

Before diving into the two, let’s define state.
In tech, state refers to the memory of a system a snapshot of what's happening or has happened at a certain point in time.

This could include:

* A user’s login session
* The contents of a shopping cart
* Where you left off in a video or form

If the system remembers this across interactions, it's dealing with state.

🔄 So What’s the Difference?

✅ Stateless: No memory between requests

Every interaction is independent. The server or component doesn’t retain information from previous interactions.

Think of it like this:

You walk into a coffee shop, order a drink, and leave.
The next day, you come back the barista doesn’t remember you. You must reintroduce yourself and re-order everything again from scratch.

In tech:

* Each HTTP request in a stateless API must contain all the information the server needs to fulfill it (e.g. tokens, credentials, parameters).
* Once a request is handled, the server doesn’t keep any info about it.
* Examples: REST APIs, DNS, HTTP by default

✅ Stateful: Memory is maintained across interactions

The system remembers previous events, data, or contexts.

You walk into your favorite coffee shop. The barista greets you by name and says, “Your usual?”
That’s a stateful interaction the shop remembers you.

In tech:

* Sessions, user data, or progress is stored between interactions.
* The server, client, or app tracks your activity or context over time.
* Examples: Database connections, WebSockets, Sessions in web apps, Online games

🤯 Why the Confusion?

People often confuse the two because they see the effects of state, but not where it’s being stored.

Here are some misconceptions:

🔸 Stateless means no user experience.

Not true stateless systems can provide rich user experiences. But the client or another service must carry the burden of storing state (e.g., localStorage, tokens, or cache).

🔸 All HTTP is stateless.

Technically, yes. HTTP is stateless.
But developers build stateful experiences on top of stateless protocols using cookies, sessions, or tokens to persist state on the client or server.

🔸 Stateful is always better.

Not necessarily. Stateful systems are more complex to scale, manage, and recover. Stateless systems are simpler and more resilient to failure.

📦 Where This Shows Up in Real Life

💻 Web Development

* Stateless: REST APIs, CDN-delivered assets
* Stateful: Login sessions, shopping carts, user dashboards

🧪 Testing & Debugging

* Stateless apps are easier to test because each interaction is isolated.
* Stateful apps require setting up a specific state before testing.

🕸️ System Design

* Stateless systems scale better because any server can handle any request.
* Stateful systems may require sticky sessions (same server every time) or distributed session management (more complexity).

🚀 Developer Tip: Know Where the State Lives

Even stateless systems have state it’s just not on the server.

The key is knowing where the state lives:

* In the client? (e.g., browser storage, JWTs)
* In a shared cache? (e.g., Redis)
* In the server? (session memory, DB)

Once you know where and how state is stored, you can:

* Debug better
* Design scalable systems
* Handle failovers and retries more gracefully

🧠 In Summary 

* Stateless: No memory of past interactions. Every request is standalone.
* Stateful: Memory is maintained between interactions. Context is preserved.
* It’s not about which is better it’s about knowing when and where to use each.

💬 Final Thought

When designing systems, apps, or APIs, always ask:
“Should this interaction remember anything?”

If yes be deliberate about how and where you manage state.
If no enjoy the simplicity and scalability of statelessness.

Your future self and your infrastructure will thank you

Coupling vs Cohesion: The Confusion That Hurts Code Quality

When developers talk about clean code or software design principles, two words often show up coupling and cohesion.

They’re tossed around so frequently that many confuse them, misuse them, or think they mean the same thing.
But understanding the difference is key to writing code that is easy to scale, test, and maintain.

Let’s break it down.

🧩 What is Cohesion?

Cohesion is about how focused and related the responsibilities within a single component, module, or class are. 

Think of it as how well the parts of a unit belong together.

Imagine a restaurant kitchen:

* A highly cohesive kitchen has chefs, tools, and stations all focused on cooking.
* If that same kitchen also managed accounting, deliveries, and marketing it would be a low-cohesion mess.

In code:

* A high-cohesion module does one job and does it well.
* A low-cohesion module does too many unrelated things making it confusing and fragile.

✅ High Cohesion = Clean, focused code.
❌ Low Cohesion = Bloated, unclear responsibility.

🔗 What is Coupling?

Coupling is about how interdependent two modules or components are.

The more one module relies on another to function, the tighter the coupling.

Imagine two coworkers:

* If one can’t work without the constant help of the other, they are tightly coupled.
* If they can each do their job independently but collaborate when needed, they’re loosely coupled.

In code:

* Tightly coupled code breaks if you change one part.
* Loosely coupled code can be modified independently and reused easily.

✅ Loose Coupling = Flexibility and maintainability
❌ Tight Coupling = Fragility and ripple-effect bugs

🤯 Why the Confusion?

Developers often mix the two up because they both deal with how parts of a system relate. But they focus on different dimensions.

A common misunderstanding is thinking that improving one automatically improves the other. But you can have:

* High cohesion but tight coupling (each module does one job, but depends too heavily on others)
* Low cohesion and loose coupling (modules don’t depend on each other, but each does too much)

The goal is to maximize cohesion and minimize coupling.

🧠 In Summary 

* Cohesion: How well the responsibilities within a module belong together.
* Coupling: How tightly one module depends on another.
* Aim for: High Cohesion + Low Coupling
* This makes your code modular, maintainable, testable, and scalable.

✨ Final Thought

Great architecture isn’t about fancy tools it’s about clean relationships.

When modules know too much about each other, systems get fragile.
When modules try to do too many things, systems become confusing.

Keep your code focused. Keep it independent.
Your future self and your teammates will thank you.
